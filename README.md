# <Gym-Fitness-App-Frontend>

Describe your app here. (What is your 1 minute “elevator pitch” of your capstone project? What problem does it solve? What inspired you to build it?)

  This app is a fitness-app. It allows users to create workouts and choose from a list of exercises to add to their workout. Each workout can be scheduled for a particular date and the user can create a workout rotation/schedule. (Future: The app allows the user to set goals and track their progress. For example, if the user wants to lose/gain weight they can create a roadmap and then input data weekly and compare their stats with their created plan's trajectory and see if they are on track.)
  
Describe the technologies you used to build your app (Ruby on Rails backend, React.js frontend, any libraries, APIs, etc.)

  My backend was built using Ruby on Rails. The Frontend is built using React.Js. One library I used was the React Calandar library in order to create a form that the user could submit a date to schedule their workout.
Optional: Add screenshots or gifs of your application

## Installation

```bash
npm install
  npm install axios
  npm install bootstrap-react
  npm install react-router-dom@6
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll need to have the backend code (add link here) running on http://localhost:3000.
You can view the app on http://localhost:5173.

## Roadmap

List any ideas you plan on implementing in the future.
