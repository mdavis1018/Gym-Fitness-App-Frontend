# <Gym-Fitness-App-Frontend>


  This app is a fitness-app. I was inspired to built this application because I have always wanted a very customizable fitness-app that allows users to set goals in a variety of ways and be able to track their progress. This application allows users to create workouts and choose from a list of exercises to add to their workout. Each workout can be scheduled for a particular date and the user can create a workout rotation/schedule. 
  
Describe the technologies you used to build your app (Ruby on Rails backend, React.js frontend, any libraries, APIs, etc.)

  My backend was built using Ruby on Rails. The Frontend is built using React.Js. One library I used was the React Calandar library in order to create a form that the user could submit a date to schedule their workout.
  - Bootstrap-React
  - Axios-React
  - React-Router
  - React-Calendar
  - Chart.Js
Optional: Add screenshots or gifs of your application

## Installation

```bash
npm install
  npm install axios
  npm install bootstrap-react
  npm install react-router-dom@6
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll need to have the backend code (add link here) running on http://localhost:3000.
You can view the app on http://localhost:5173.

## Roadmap

- Using the drag and drop react library I plan on allowing users to drag a particular exercise into one of their workouts. This will improve the UI overall.
 - I plan on using the chart.js library to create interactive graphs in which the user can see their data displayed in a visualized way. 
 - I plan on implementing an exercise db to the backend that allows users to select from thousands of exercises.
